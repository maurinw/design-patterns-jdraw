/**
 * The `jdraw.framework` package contains the core interfaces and foundational
 * implementations of the JDraw editor framework. This package defines the main
 * contracts that outline the architecture of the application, including
 * figures, drawing models, views, tools, and listeners. It serves as the
 * backbone of the JDraw application, enabling extensibility and providing the
 * essential components required to build and manipulate graphic elements within
 * the editor.
 *
 * Key interfaces such as `Figure`, `DrawModel`, `DrawView`, and `DrawTool` are
 * defined here, providing the necessary abstractions for creating and
 * interacting with graphical objects. This package supports the implementation
 * of custom figures, tools, and behaviors, allowing developers to extend and
 * enhance the functionality of the JDraw editor.
 * 
 * By adhering to the interfaces in this package, developers can ensure
 * compatibility with the framework's components and maintain a consistent
 * interaction model across various parts of the application.
