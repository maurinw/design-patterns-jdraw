/**
 * The `jdraw.std` package contains standard or default implementations of the
 * framework interfaces defined in the JDraw application. These implementations
 * provide basic functionality to get the application up and running but are
 * intended to be enhanced or replaced by more optimized and feature-complete
 * versions as part of the development process or course assignments.
 * 
 * The classes in this package serve as a starting point, offering a reference
 * implementation that demonstrates the basic principles of the framework.
 * Developers are encouraged to extend, modify, or entirely replace these
 * standard implementations to meet the specific requirements of their
 * application or to improve performance, usability, and functionality.
 * 
 * Typical enhancements might include better data structures, more efficient
 * algorithms, additional features, or improved user interactions tailored to
 * the needs of the JDraw editor.
